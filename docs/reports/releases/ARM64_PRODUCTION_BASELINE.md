# ios-linuxkit ARM64 production baseline

> **Dated report:** This baseline describes the May 2026 `go` branch and package set. It is not the current `master` release procedure. Use [the maintained iOS guide](../../IOS_APPLICATION.md) and [validation guide](../../VALIDATION.md).

## Known-good code

- Code baseline: `go` branch at 2026-05-22, successor to tagged validation point `arm64-openjdk21-prod-20260513-r6`. This pass adds all prior fixes plus an executor performance pass: adjacent same-page `fiber_ret_chain` fast path (−6.6% shell loop, −2.3% Bun JSON) and `GEN_INTERNAL_CONTINUE_MAX` raised 4→6.
- Previous tagged production audit baseline: `arm64-openjdk21-prod-20260513-r6` (post-r5 validation point covering 44/44 staged coverage, Benchmarks Game refresh, Java mixed/interpreter probes, and go-gte smoke; the current `go` branch adds Rust/Cargo, socket ABI, npm CLI package lane, `fchmodat2`, scheduler priority syscall, Docker diagnostic, C# NativeAOT SDK-availability, internal-continue/taken-internal, high-address reservation, UDP extended-error, and ARM64-only cleanup fixes).
- Branch: `go`.
- Remote target for this working branch: `https://github.com/rcarmo/ios-linuxkit.git`; `origin` is configured to this repository for fetch and push.

## Validation artifacts

- Runtime coverage: `/workspace/tmp/ish-arm64-runtime-coverage-alpine324.md`
  - Result: **83 / 83 passing**
- npm CLI package runtime coverage: `/workspace/tmp/ish-arm64-cli-package-runtime-coverage-20260515-200605.md`
  - Result: 16 / 16 passing on the Alpine npm lane.
  - Includes unauthenticated install/startup/version/help probes for fast-moving npm CLI packages; the Debian/glibc lane remains blocked by thread/libuv thread creation failures.
- Go Benchmarks Game smoke: `/workspace/tmp/benchmarksgame-go-smoke-20260513-144802.md`
  - Result: 10 / 10 passing
- Default mixed-mode Java Hello smoke: `/workspace/tmp/java-hello-audit-r5-20260512.log`
  - `javac_rc:0`
  - `java_rc:0`
- Production baseline capture: `/workspace/tmp/ish-arm64-production-baseline-20260510.txt`
- Local production deployment/post-deploy smoke: [ARM64_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md](ARM64_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Production-readiness notes

- OpenJDK default mixed mode is enabled; no `-Xint`, `-XX:-UseCompiler`, `ReplayIgnoreInitErrors`, `DisableIntrinsic`, or runtime/user-data patch is required for the validated Java smoke.
- The final audit pass also hardens host/guest launch plumbing: initial argv construction is bounds-checked, ELF `PT_INTERP` names are bounded and explicitly NUL-terminated, and shebang trimming no longer walks before the optional argument string.
- ARM64 synthetic non-null read-fault recovery remains compile-time gated by `ENABLE_ARM64_READ_FAULT_RECOVERY` and disabled in production builds.
- Guest self-modifying/JIT-patched code invalidation, `CLREX`, `LDXR` widths, `LDPSW`, `DMB`/`DSB`/`ISB`, per-thread `sigaltstack`, `fchmodat2(AT_EMPTY_PATH)`, scheduler priority syscalls, high-address `MAP_NORESERVE` reservation overlap, C# NativeAOT SDK availability, and Python/Lua/Java/Clojure/PyPy/Swift/Rust/Erlang/Zig toolchain startup/codegen or availability coverage are covered by runtime fixtures. Speculative ARM64 hot-trace candidate instrumentation has been removed; retained executor diagnostics are block/chaining/prechain counters only.
- Host OS differences for sysinfo, thread rusage, fd path lookup, stat timestamp fields, random bytes, thread naming, and memory-pressure hooks are centralized through `platform/platform.h`.

## Rollback point

- Roll back to `2074a6a4` if the exec/shebang/initial-argv audit tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `c4f10affbc99b0038f45fa659730d669c5b10aa2` if the final logging/mount-option audit tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `17d68ad6fbcedab918e883c1637f254f384c2a73` if the timed-wait cleanup tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `b38c6239b08270889fc32a33c7095cf376785ba6` if the barrier-audit tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `0711a849c96889c1225bf4e253607bbd8c4abd7d` if the platform/proc audit tranche regresses production behavior.
- Roll back to `6ea7153e` only if Java C2/LDPSW behavior must be isolated from the Go `sigaltstack` fix.

## Remaining known limitations

- Non-production diagnostic compatibility for ARM64 read-fault recovery exists behind `ENABLE_ARM64_READ_FAULT_RECOVERY`; keep it disabled unless explicitly debugging.
- Native offload and socket/poll implementations still contain host-specific implementation branches outside `platform/platform.h`; the second socket audit hardened Unix socket backing paths, accept/name buffers, send/receive buffer allocation, ARM64 control-message layout/validation, socket-option buffers, and bind-failure cleanup, but broader host-specific socket/poll cleanup remains a future candidate.
- The legacy x86 guest/backend has been removed from this ARM64-only baseline; keep future validation focused on AArch64 guest behavior and host portability.
